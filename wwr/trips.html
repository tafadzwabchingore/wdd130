            <figcaption><h3>RAFTING EXPERIENCE DAY TRIP</h3>
                Choose between our famous one day trip for a taste of the action or our overnight, two night and 
                four night rafting experiences that take you to parts of the Zambezi very few people get to see. 
                On these longer trips, after a hard day rafting, relax with a cold beer on a white sandy beach and enjoy the peace, 
                quiet and tranquillity of the gorge. 
                You‚Äôll sleep in tents, enjoy freshly cooked meals and experience the stars of a clear African night.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><h3>PADDLE RAFTS</h3>
                Paddle Rafts are the craziest option where the guide and guests all have paddles. There are no frame or oars and the guide shouts 
                instructions as guests navigate rapids under the guide‚Äôs watchful eyes. Imagine going through a class 5 rapid without holding onto the rope but 
                just a paddle with your guide shouting instructions to paddle hard.We make brief stops above some rapids to give our  guests options 
                and explain how we run the next rapid, chances of the boat going upside down, and where the safety kayaker will be waiting to pick you up 
                if you end up in the water.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><h3>STERN MOUNT RAFTS</h3>
                Stern Mount Rafts are good for everyone family, seniors &  those who have done rafting before but prefer not to swim. 
                This raft is the same as the free paddle, except it has a frame at the back with a spine board. 
                Guests paddle with the assistance of the guide rowing his oars. The guide is in full control of the raft even if the guests do not paddle. 
                Guests can paddle through the small waves then stop and hold onto the safety line in the rapids & kids can just seat at the middle or front of the raft 
                with a special strap from USA to hold onto. On this type of a boat, chances of flipping are very slim to none since the guide does not need 
                much assistance to maneuver.</figcaption>
