            <p>Hello! My name is Tafadzwa Chingore. I am from Zimbabwe. I am the youngest child in a family of two. I want to become a Frontend Web Developer. I am enjoy reading, mountain-hiking and puzzles. I love learning new things hence my passion for reading. My passion for hiking started when I was invited by a friend to go mountain-hiking with her and some other mutual friends. Going up was hard but by after the hike I was looking forward to doing it again and now I am always looking forward to more hiking trips. My greatest strength is determination. I believe with God I can do anything, as long as I put effort and my mind to what I am doing. </p>

            <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa known for its dramatic landscape and diverse wildlife, much of it within parks, reserves and safari areas. The name Zimbabwe is derived from the Shona words, dzimba dzemabwe, meaning houses of stone or stone buildings, symbolizing the Great Zimbabwe Ruins near the present day town of Masvingo.</p>
